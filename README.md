# HTML-CSS-learning-process
This is the main way I learn and practice HTML/CSS elements. It could be helpful for someone just starting out that just want a well organized group of files containg basic code elements.
every file can be considered a little chapter of a book (this is in fact what is explained in HTML&CSS by Jon Ducket!).
there may also be some files containing flex class and bootstrap elements.
enjoy!
